# Remote-Work-Dynamic-Content
This is a dynamic graph object that shows the various aspects of remote work. The best aspects of remote work and the worst aspects of remote work are alternated in a slide bar. There is also an option to automatically loop the
different factors using the 'loop' toggle. Users could put the entity on 'reflect' mode so that it moves back and forth. You can simply check out the embedded content for yourself at https://sites.google.com/view/shaunjay .
